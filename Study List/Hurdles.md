# Massive Hurdles

 - No finished degree (moving speech?) 
 - No Lead developer title (Possibly ask Doug with a bribe?)
    - If it is good enough, go ahead & ask

    # Possible bribes(After technical interview):
    - Finish the last project for free
    - Train the new person for one day for free
