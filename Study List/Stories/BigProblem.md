# A time when you saved the day / solved a big problem:
I was creating the software for a nationwide weight loss competition. The promo had already gone out for the launch & was starting in a month.

# Tasks
Creating an interface to capture user data before the contest, then another page for the after information, pictures 45 days later. Then I was tasked with creating a judgement dashboard that could search for users, sort on multiple criteria & progressively load contestants. That used AJAX to handle client side errors & then securely clean & process it server side. 

I tried to create the website by tackling the development problem by problem, but quickly realized that I needed a plan especially if I was going to work collaboratively. I mocked up rough designs I was working with and collaborated on ideas with the designers. I was able to reuse common pieces of the application e.g buttons & form cleaning operations to speed up my development & deliver the application early.

There were many mentors higher up in the workplace that I was able to learn from. Book recommendations, podcasts. Then I proposed & implemented a referral feature that allowed for 5000 new sign ups.

 I received commendation from the Senior developers on the team. & We were able to capture $120000 in signup revenue. This was my favorite project because I was able to see Rodney, who lost 50 pounds in 45 days, cry when he received the 20,000 dollar prize. 
 
I loved this project because I was able to create joy with my application.
