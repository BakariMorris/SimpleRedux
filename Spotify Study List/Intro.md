# Intro
I am a Front End Engineer with 4+ years of experience. I have worked for a number of industries specialize in creating performant Javascript & React components. 


Invaluable I created fast JavaScript features to replace legacy processes. I used vanilla JavaScript and React to make these components as modular and scalable as possible.
At Aretove I created performant React features & was the principal A/B tester on my team. I worked cross functionaly with designers & the director of A/B testing to increase conversion sitewide by 10%.
I was in charge of creating a new site React website for Conair. I was able to architect & delegate features to consistently deliver a better experience ahead of schedule.


With my experience A/B testing I always keep a customer first focus on my products. I enjoy working with my team to tackle tough design and engineering challenges.
