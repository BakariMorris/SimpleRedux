# Communication:
 I recommend that, after you are done reading and understanding the problem statement, you type out all of the possible algorithmic approaches in plain English, starting with those which are brute-force. Maybe add some bits of pseudocode. This will be a good conversation starter about optimizing your approach, time/space complexity, finer details etc.

I recommend that you preemptively volunteer to dry-run your logic on one of the examples, visually, to make sure the interviewer is on-board with your thinking.
As well, please always volunteer to state the time and space complexity before you start coding.

# Problem solving:
The one area of weakness we discovered today is recursion. Here I think you have not yet made the leap from conceptual understanding to practical problem solving fluency.

As well, one of your major areas of weakness we discovered today is Big-O notation / time and space complexity analysis. I recommend you start working on this right away.
Look for well-made YT videos on the topic, my recommendations are:

I recommend you make a deliberate effort to bring more structure into your approach to interviewing, I have pasted a few resources I hope you will find useful:
