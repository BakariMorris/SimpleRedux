# Time I failed in a project

# Problem
I was working on creating a new web page that relied heavily on a third party store locator. The CSS file for this third party application had !important on every single property.

# Action
I created more !important code inside of that CSS file to add my own styling. The senior web developers on the team were not happy & rejected my PR. I consulted my team for advice on the situation & I ended up spending the time recreating the entire stylesheet with new specificity.

I learned that communication was extremely !important to warn the stakeholders of any problems before the deadline. I also learned that if something is broken, just fix it. Don't add to bad code when you can make it better.

# Result
I was able to use the lessons learned when I came across any weird code in the future. I made sure to NEVER just go along with a bad process just because it would save some time. It will always come back to bite you in the future.
