# A time when you worked with a difficult person & how you handled it:
I worked with a senior developer that was understandably very busy but very terse & hard to collaborate with. 

# Task
Develop features for an application they built. It was difficult to get answers on where functions are located & how things were supposed to work.

# Solution
I reached out to my team members to figure out how they solved this issue in the past. Many recommended building a rapport with the team member & understanding their issues.

It was tough in the beginning but I spoke to them in person to figure out his problems. I realized that they had a tough time communicating when under plenty of stress. I was able to propose a solution to a problem he was working on and we were able to have lunch & get to know each other better. This allowed us to collaborate with less friction on future projects.

90% of the time they are not trying to be difficult on purpose. There is usually some issue and we can find a way to help.
